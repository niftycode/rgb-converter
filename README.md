# rgb-converter

## About

This is my first Tkinter project. A simple program that converts hex values to RGB values and vice versa. The code is anything but perfect, but quite acceptable for a first attempt (the program works at least to some extent).

For me, it is a test field to deal more with the Tk interface. For other developers, it may serve as a starting point for their own Tkinter projects.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Pillow

This program was developed on macOS, but it should also work on a Linux system or Windows 10/11.
